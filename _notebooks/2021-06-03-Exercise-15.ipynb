    "## Questions\n",
    "1. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n",
    "> Note: No, because the data in the validation set should come from an area where your predictions will find place e.g. Future \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is overfitting? Provide an example.\n",
    "> Note: When your model exactly learns to deal with your training data. (Fits perfectly to trainingdata but achieves bad results when using the model against data outside of the training set)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a metric? How does it differ from “loss”?\n",
    "> Note: A metric is a function that measures quality of the models predictions using the validation set. The loss function is used by the computer to decide how to update the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can pretrained models help?\n",
    "> Note: By doing transfer learning -> fine tune a pretrained model to a specific problem\n",

    "5. What is the “head” of a model?\n",
    "> Note: The part that has already been given in the pretrained model --> early layers\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?\n",
    "> Note: Early: Diagonal lines, gradiants, specific colors -- Late: The combinations of features from previous layers - repeating patterns, and later more complex things like dogfaces etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Are image models only useful for photos?\n",
