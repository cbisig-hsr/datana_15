    "> Note:  Because we don't know based on what this decision was made\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?\n",

    "> Note:   No they are resized if they have a wrong size\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is the difference between classification and regression?\n",
    "> Note:   Classification puts data into different classes whereas regression gives you a continious number based on your input\n",
    "\n",
    "20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n",
    "> Note:   They are used to check how well the model works and ensure that there is no overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set?\n",
    "> Note:   The default value is 0.2 therefore there are always 20% of the data in the validation set"
