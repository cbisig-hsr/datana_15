            "content": "About . This notebook contains the solutions of exercise 3 of week 15 of the data analytics course . Video 1 . . Questions . Do you need these for deep learning? | Lots of math T / F | Lots of data T / F | Lots of expensive computers T / F | A PhD T / F . Note: None of the listed things | . Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world. . Note: playing Chess, Playing Go, product recommendations, financial forecasting, text to speech, speech recognition | What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron? . Note: Mark 1 Perceptron | Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)? . Note: Processing units, state of activation, output function, pattern of connectivity, propagation rule, activation rule, learning rule, environment | What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks? . Note: They only looked at a single layer which cannot do very much and focuesed on this problem without recognizing that multiple layers could do much more interesting things. | What is a GPU? . Note: Graphics processing unit | Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens? . Note: Calculates 1+1 --&gt; shows 2 | Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen. . Warning: No soultion | Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix. . Warning: No soultion | Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo? . Note: Because we can&#8217;t write down the stpes (if else etc.) that are necessary (all steps in greate detail) | What did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”? . Note: Parametrizing the model | What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called “weights”? . Note: Parameters | Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel’s view of a machine learning model. . Note: | Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction? . Note: Because we don&#8217;t know based on what this decision was made | What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy? . Note: Universal approximation theorem | What do you need in order to train a model? . Note: Labeld data | How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model? . Note: The model is getting biased towards some wrong assumptions that are represented by the data | Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model? . Note: No they are resized if they have a wrong size | What is the difference between classification and regression? . Note: Classification puts data into different classes whereas regression gives you a continious number based on your input | What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them? . Note: They are used to check how well the model works and ensure that there is no overfitting | What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set? . Note: The default value is 0.2 therefore there are always 20% of the data in the validation set | Video 2 . youtube: https://youtu.be/BvHmRx14HQ8 . Questions .",
