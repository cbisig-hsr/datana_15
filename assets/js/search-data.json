            "content": "About . This notebook contains the solutions of exercise 3 of week 15 of the data analytics course . Video 1 . . Questions . Do you need these for deep learning? | Lots of math T / F | Lots of data T / F | Lots of expensive computers T / F | A PhD T / F . Note: None of the listed things | . Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world. . Note: playing Chess, Playing Go, product recommendations, financial forecasting, text to speech, speech recognition | What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron? . Note: Mark 1 Perceptron | Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)? . Note: Processing units, state of activation, output function, pattern of connectivity, propagation rule, activation rule, learning rule, environment | What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks? . Note: They only looked at a single layer which cannot do very much and focuesed on this problem without recognizing that multiple layers could do much more interesting things. | What is a GPU? . Note: Graphics processing unit | Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens? . Note: Calculates 1+1 --&gt; shows 2 | Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen. . Warning: No soultion | Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix. . Warning: No soultion | Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo? . Note: Because we can&#8217;t write down the stpes (if else etc.) that are necessary (all steps in greate detail) | What did Samuel mean by “weight assignment”? . Note: Parametrizing the model | What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called “weights”? . Note: Parameters | Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel’s view of a machine learning model. . | Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction? . Note: Because we don&#8217;t know based on what this decision was made . | What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy? . Note: Universal approximation theorem | What do you need in order to train a model? . Note: Labeld data | How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model? . Note: The model is getting biased towards some wrong assumptions that are represented by the data | Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model? . Note: No they are resized if they have a wrong size | What is the difference between classification and regression? . Note: Classification puts data into different classes whereas regression gives you a continious number based on your input | What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them? . Note: They are used to check how well the model works and ensure that there is no overfitting | What will fastai do if you don’t provide a validation set? . Note: The default value is 0.2 therefore there are always 20% of the data in the validation set | Video 2 . . Questions . Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not? . Note: No, because the data in the validation set should come from an area where your predictions will find place e.g. Future | What is overfitting? Provide an example. . Note: When your model exactly learns to deal with your training data. (Fits perfectly to trainingdata but achieves bad results when using the model against data outside of the training set) | What is a metric? How does it differ from “loss”? . Note: A metric is a function that measures quality of the models predictions using the validation set. The loss function is used by the computer to decide how to update the parameters. | How can pretrained models help? . Note: By doing transfer learning -&gt; fine tune a pretrained model to a specific problem | What is the “head” of a model? . Note: The part that has already been given in the pretrained model --&gt; early layers | What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers? . Note: Early: Diagonal lines, gradiants, specific colors -- Late: The combinations of features from previous layers - repeating patterns, and later more complex things like dogfaces etc. | Are image models only useful for photos? . Note: No they can be used for different problems as well - e.g. soud detection, fraud protection etc. | What is an architecture? . Note: The template of the model that we&#8217;re trying to fit. | What is segmentation? . Note: Splitting an object into different segments e.g Streets, cars, trees, road signals etc | What is y_range used for? When do we need it? . Note: The y_range is used to define the range of our target | What are hyperparameters? . Note: A hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process | What’s the best way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization? . Note: Don&#8217;t use it for conversations | What is a p value? . Note: The probability of an observed result assuming that the null hypothesis is true. | What is a prior? . Note: Guess about what&#8217;s the most likely scenario | Provide an example of where the bear classification model might work poorly in production, due to structural or style differences in the training data. . Note: When there are many pictures that were resized in the trainig set but not in the actual input set | Where do text models currently have a major deficiency? . Note: Deep learning is currently not good at generating correct responses! | What are possible negative societal implications of text generation models? . Note: Spread disinformation, create unrest, and encourage conflic | In situations where a model might make mistakes, and those mistakes could be harmful, what is a good alternative to automating a process? . Note: Supervising the automated process or just partially automate the process | What kind of tabular data is deep learning particularly good at? . Note: Data with a big variety of columns. | What’s a key downside of directly using a deep learning model for recommendation systems? . Note: They only tell you what products a particular user might like, rather than what recommendations would be helpful for a user. | What are the steps of the Drivetrain Approach? . Note: 1) Define Objective 2) Decide what inputs can be controled (levers) 3) What data do we have and what data can we collect 4) Create the models | How do the steps of the Drivetrain Approach map to a recommendation system? . Note: 1) drive additional sales by surprising and delighting the customer with recommendations of items they would not have purchased without the recommendation 2) The lever is the ranking of the recommendations 3) New data must be collected to generate recommendations that will cause new sales 4) build two models for purchase probabilities, conditional on seeing or not seeing a recommendation | Create an image recognition model using data you curate, and deploy it on the web. . Warning: No solution in this blog post | What is DataLoaders? . Note: A fastai class that stores multiple DataLoader objects you pass to it, normally a train and a valid | What four things do we need to tell fastai to create DataLoaders? . Note: What kinds of data we are working with / How to get the list of items / How to label these items / How to create the validation set | What does the splitter parameter to DataBlock do? . Note: Tells the DataBlock how to split the data into the training and validation set | How do we ensure a random split always gives the same validation set? . Note: Set a fixed seed -&gt; random numbers then will always be the same | .",
